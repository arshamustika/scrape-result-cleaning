A Python script to clean and normalize the article content from scrapping process saved in a CSV file. In addition to parsing and cleaning the text, the script extracts only the main story content, removing URLs and other unnecessary metadata.
The cleaned articles are saved as individual text files. Each row in the CSV corresponds to one text file, with filenames generated using the notation, article date, and a truncated version of the article title (limited to 30 characters). The title is trimmed to prevent issues when extracting zipped files caused by excessively long filenames.
